<h1> Perfect Movies According To Rafael </h1>
<h2> My absolute favorites </h2>

<hr />

<h3>1) Kill Bill (both parts) </h3>x
<h4> Caution, spoilers!!</h4>
<p>
The movie is about a girl who had previously been an assasin.<br />
She was working for a guy named Bill who had a whole band of assasins.<br />
Then the girl decided to quit and have a quiet and a peaceful life somewhere in the woods.<br />
So then she gets shot by Bill and the other assasins while pregnant at her own wedding<br />
Somehow she stays alive and plans a big and bloody revenge to all of them <br />
</p>
<h4> Rating: A solid 9/10. </h4>

<h3>2) The Godfather (trilogy)</h3>
<p> 
First two parts are the greatest mafia movies ever, but the third part wasn't on the same level.<br />
Absolute masterpiece with Al Pacino playing the goat himself Michael Corleone.
</p>

<h4>Rating: First two parts are 9.5/10 but overall the trilogy itself is a 8.5/10</h4>
